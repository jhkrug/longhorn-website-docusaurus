Not needed by Docusaurus. These are the configuration files for Docsearch.

Here, as it's somewhere to preserve them.

The API ID and API key docsearch-crawler-config.json are generated by Algolia,
it's the rest of the configuration that you need. Don't just ovewrite the rest
the config in the crawler configuration editor on Algolia.
